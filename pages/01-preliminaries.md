One of the unofficial roles of technical director is [“bastion of posterity”](http://www.nouse.co.uk/2009/04/27/a-window-to-the-past/) -- this means making sure nothing gets unnecessarily lost or deleted.
This includes making sure all edition PDFs are uploaded to the website for example. Backups of all indesign content on the filestore is handled by the University storage service we use.
When dramatic changes have occurred, we’ve archived static versions.

Articles themselves should be kept online unless under legal threat -- [removing them from search engines, or editing them](removing-content.html), may be a suitable compromise if there are concerns.

It is also nice if you keep an eye on articles put up on the website by other people to make sure that everything is done properly (e.g. article images sized properly, excerpts added).
This will probably all become clearer as you read the rest of this guide.
Basically, hopefully you’ll feel the need - and want - to keep everything looking and working amazing, and keep Nouse’s heritage going from the past and into the future.

## Joining the Tech Team

Any person joining the tech team will need to be given access to the various tech systems.

* G Suite Administrator Console
* Filestore - https://permman.york.ac.uk/
* University VM (yorknouse01.york.ac.uk)
* DigitalOcean
* GitHub
* GoogleDrive Team Drive for passwords
* GoogleDrive Team Drive access for Photography Team Drive (those who should have manager access should be the TD, Editor, Deputy Editor, MUSE Editor, Deputy MUSE Editor, Photo Editor and Deputy Photo Editor)
* JIRA
* Facebook "Business" account (https://business.facebook.com/overview) - NOT just the Facebook Page Itself

When the tech director changes it is important to transfer the ownership of university issues univ accounts to ensure they do not expire and require resetting by IT Services.
