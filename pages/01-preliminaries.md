One of the unofficial roles of technical director is [“bastion of posterity”](http://www.nouse.co.uk/2009/04/27/a-window-to-the-past/) -- this means making sure nothing gets unnecessarily lost or deleted.
This includes making sure all editions are archived to the back up hard drives, all edition PDFs are uploaded to the website, and all minisites continue to appear as they did when they were put up.
For mini-sites, this is made easier by the fact that the majority contain year conditional clauses (which can be added to) that contain the individual content/layout for that year’s site, although make sure not to overwrite stylesheets or images as well.
When dramatic changes have occurred, we’ve archived static versions.

Articles themselves should be kept online unless under legal threat -- [removing them from search engines, or editing them](removing-content.html), may be a suitable compromise if there are concerns.

It is also nice if you keep an eye on articles put up on the website by other people to make sure that everything is done properly (e.g. article images sized properly, excerpts added).
This will probably all become clearer as you read the rest of this guide.
Basically, hopefully you’ll feel the need - and want - to keep everything looking and working amazing, and keep Nouse’s heritage going from the past and into the future.
