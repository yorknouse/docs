Remote login to the servers and office iMacs is done through SSH. 

If you’re using Linux or Mac OS X then an SSH client is built in:

    ssh username@nouse.co.uk

If you’re using Windows then one way to log in is using the PuTTY client, which you can get as a standalone application or installer from its website, and which is also installed on all PCs on campus.

If you lose your SSH keys, the Lish Ajax Console in the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com/session/index) (under Remote Access) allows password authentication.
