Ads on the site are arranged by the Managing Director who sends them to us for upload - this is done manually by hardcoding it into the template, although doing this through the backend is a pending feature request. 

If there are no ads to display the site will fallback to Google AdSense, and will therefore display conventional web advertising in the placeholders. This is in the yorknousetechnicaldirector@gmail.com account
