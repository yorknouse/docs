Most of the website lives in some [Git][git] repositories.

We have [a GitHub organisation][gh] which you should be invited to.

Our friends at [URY][ury] and [YSTV][ystv] are pioneers.

## Git clients

Some of us use Git from the command line.
There are are plenty of [tutorials](https://try.github.io/) floating around the internet.

Otherwise, GitHub [for Mac](https://mac.github.com) and [for Windows](https://windows.github.com) are good and free, as is [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

## Hygeine

There are plenty of recommendations about Git "workflows" online.

Commits to our `master` branch can be expected to go live as soon as they are pushed (see [deployment](#deployment) below).
But you should commit and push regularly -- so commit to a branch other than `master`, and merge your changes into `master` when you're ready.
