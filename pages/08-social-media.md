## Twitter

We have four Twitter accounts altogether: [@yorknouse](https://www.twitter.com/yorknouse), [@nousemuse](https://www.twitter.com/nousemuse), [@nouselive](https://www.twitter.com/nouselive) and [@nousesport](https://www.twitter.com/nousesport).  These accounts are normally the responsibility of the Social Media Director.

IFTT (and also possibly Buffer) are used to tweet automatically onto these accounts.  Things have gotten a bit mangled by them in the past so we need to investigate revoking the old services and setting them up again.


## Google+

## Flickr

Our account is at flickr.com/yorknouse

It used to be a premium account.

As of October 2013 (not long after we stopped paying...), it has been marked as "restricted" by Flickr, so it's hard to see anything without logging in.
Despite our attempts to go through and correctly tag any pictures of streakers at football matches, it remains restricted, and they won't tell us which of the thousands of pictures there is a problem with.

Photos are often uploaded here and kept private to easily be transferred between people without being seen by outsiders.

Slideshows of photos on Flickr can be added to articles:

* Images for slideshows need to be uploaded to Flickr, made public and all given the same tag.
* Slideshows are then included in posts by adding the code `[flickr-slideshow tags="tagnames" caption="CaptionText"]`, although the format `<div class="slideshow" title="the-name-of-the-tag"></div>` also works for historical reasons.
* Other options **could at one point be** added to slideshows by adding the following to the title attribute after the tag name, all separated with a space in between them. The current plugin no longer supports these options.
  * `size=large` – makes images slightly larger
  * `extras=attachments` – may not work but should also add any images uploaded to the current post through WordPress to the slideshow
  * `layout=thumbnail` – adds a thumbnail gallery of each image underneath the slideshow
  * `limit=number` – limits the slideshow to a certain number of images
  * `start=date` – uses the date format DD-MM-YYYY to limit photos by the dates they were uploaded on...
  * `end=date` – ...anything uploaded between the start and end dates will be shown

(The Wordpress gallery feature can be used to create identical-looking slideshows, but Flickr seems to be preferred.)


## Instagram

There are two Instagram accounts: [yorknouse](https://www.instagram.com/yorknouse) and [nousefashion](https://www.instagram.com/nousefashion).  The main account is currently underused.  We used to be able to run Instagram feeds on pages but this feature has recently broken.

## Facebook

There are Facebook pages used for several things.  These are handled by the Social Media Director, and access is granted to the Facebook Business Manager by them.  They also use IFTTT (and Buffer) to post automatically to these accounts.

Each of the paper sections maintains a section Facebook Group for their writers.  There are also often groups for events the occur throughout the year, which the Tech team are often useful in.

We also have a Facebook app for use with the account system, which the Tech Director owns.

## Rightster
