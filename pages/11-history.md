The original Nouse site was launched in 2003 after York Vision dabbled with a site in around 2000 - in 2002 they won Best Student Website in the Guardian Student Media awards. A copy is available [at the internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20031128104148/http://www.nouse.co.uk:80/)

It was moved WordPress during the summer of 2005. [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20051124022528/http://www.nouse.co.uk:80/)

The 2003-2005 content was migrated by the then technical director Chris Northwood to the WordPress site in 2009

## Move to internal CMS

Based on similar moves by University Radio York to move their site over to its own [purpose built CMS](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/2016-site) and a similar move by York Student Television ([Github](https://github.com/YSTV)), [James Bithell](https://github.com/jbithell) developed a purpose built CMS for Nouse with an entierly new theme for the frontend component. 
The biggest challenge associated with this migration was the sheer volume of articles and comments that the site had amassed (see table correct as at migration). To ensure their readability post migration a backup of every article was taken and coverted to a PDF.
