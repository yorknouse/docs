We have a web server.
It is currently supplied by Digital Ocean

## Node.js

There are some apps which run using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).  These can be a bit temperamental at times.

### Ideas

Viddyprinter could do with some extra admin features to make managing events a bit easier.
It would also be nice to allow for in game scores to be better configurable with different sports having different profiles (but that would take some work)

Account is horrible and isn't really fit for it's current purpose (and never totally was).  A better user management system that integrates into other services we have (Google Apps, Slack, WordPress) would be a really nice addition.
